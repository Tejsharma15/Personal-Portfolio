                        <h2>BounceUp game</h2>
                        <p>A 2D game built using c++ library SDL2. Has a points and leaderboard feature. Built from scratch.</p>
                        <p>Taken inspiration from the original game BounceUP, it is a single player game where the objective is to clear the level and collect maximum coins also at the same time
                            avoiding obstacles. The time of the player is also counted which will effect the scoreboard. Ball rotation and a simple physics engine helps with the motion of the ball.
                        </p>
                        <p>Future scope: This application currently has only one level. Multiple levels can be added, with the difficulty increasing after each level. The physics engine can be made mode complex
                            to include gravity. This would enhance the player experience.
                        </p>

                        <h2>A blockchain gaming DApp</h2>
                        <p>Built a blockchain betting DApp in the Ethereum blockchain and deployed it on Polygon.</p>
                        <p>
                            With the popularity of betting games and football increasing in India, the next step would be to take this to the crypto world. This betting DApp allows users to place bets on premier league
                            matches. Deployed on the polygon network, it uses moralis for user authentication. Users get instant money based on match results and it also provides transparency to the whole process.
                        </p>
                        <p>Future scope: This game is currently built only for certain teams. So scaling the project would be beneficial. It also needs an enhancement in the UI. A NFT marketplace can be made inside for buying merchandise</p>
